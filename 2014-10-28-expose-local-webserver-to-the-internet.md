There are situations where you start development on your machine using XAMPP or WAMPP. This is an ideal local development environment and there are requirements where your development needs to be tested or looked at by someone remotely or from another machine.

This can be achieved by tunneling your local web server port using <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a>(Windows) which gives an url for accessing your local web server through internet.This url can be shared with anyone and your local development can be viewed by anyone over the internet.
