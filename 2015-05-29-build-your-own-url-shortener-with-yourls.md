URL shorteners reached their peak in usefulness just before Twitter began encoding all links with its t.co URL shortener. Up to that point, URL shorteners helped people tweet multiple links without using up their 140 characters. Today, every link in a tweet takes up a fixed number of characters regardless of length; using your own link shortener is now less important. Back then, <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">Bit.ly</span> was a popular choice.
