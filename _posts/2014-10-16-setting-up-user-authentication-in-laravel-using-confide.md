User authentication is part of almost every web application. Although it is common, a deeper look shows that itâ€™s not as simple as it may seem. Remember that validation, password recovery, and email confirmation are vital to any decent authentication form.

<a href="https://github.com/Zizaco/confide">Confide</a> is an authentication solution for <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> made to reduce the repetitive work involving the management of users. It's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> approach on features like account creation, login, logout, confirmation by e-mail, password reset, etc.
