This error is common in L5.2 as they have introduced concept of group middleware "web". The most common solution is to add csrf token properly in form or head section and using the "web" middleware group. If you have already done all these, then the issue is with sessions as the token values are compared by storing in session with value from form.So make sure you set correct session driver, either file or database,also check session.php config file. In my case, I had set "secure=&gt;true" which was causing the issue as I was using non-https domain.
