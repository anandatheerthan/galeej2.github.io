<p class="first-text">At a glance, Google Drive doesn't allow you to sort files by size, which makes clearing out space kind of a pain. Thankfully, Digital Inspiration points to a hidden little spot where you can find that info.</p>

<div id="js_adsense-container"> If you hover your mouse over the "space used" text in the bottom left corner in Drive, then select Drive, you'll get a list of your files sorted by file size. Better yet, you can just head to <a href="http://drive.google.com/#quota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive.google.com/#quota</a> to get to that sorting method immedietly. If you need to free up space, this makes things a lot easier.</div>
