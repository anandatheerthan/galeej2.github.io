Reflection is generally defined as a program's ability to inspect itself and modify its logic at execution time. In less technical terms, reflection is asking an object to tell you about its properties and methods, and altering those members (even private ones). In this lesson, we'll dig into how this is accomplished, and when it might prove useful.
