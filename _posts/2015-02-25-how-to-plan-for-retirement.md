There are several choices and some will work to your advantage more than others. The time to find out which would work the best is not after the fact. By then you could be paying heavy penalties, something you can not afford to do.

Then we meet our partners and get married. Thus we begin our next chapter in life. Our cart becomes heavier and we now worry about our spouse's bills and loans and kids allowance. Some of us must support our parents too. We may even need to bring our family to vacation. As we grow older, our carts get heavier and heavier. Do you have enough savings to meet these expenses?

Finding a reliable gold IRA custodian is one of the most crucial steps to making this transformation process a successful one. A gold IRA custodian is usually a bank or brokerage who guides you through the 401k rollover process as well as securely safeguards your precious metals.

I found (won) my financial planner through a newspaper reality financial planning contest - a blessing, really.

Knowing how to trade gold is a specialized skill so not every 401k is going to allow the option. You can check with your Human Resources department or benefits administrator to find out more about your individual 401k. It is important to realize that you are not buying gold coins when you invest in a <a href="http://Www.Twitpic.com/tag/precious+metals">precious metals</a> fund within your 401k. This is gold at a different level. That said, precious metals are risky. Yes, gold has been steady or rising for the last 14 months. While that is a good sign, what goes up will come down. Commodity trading is one of the riskier ways to invest. There are too many variables for the average investor to keep in mind.

A Commercial Driver's License will be required, and you'll need a 3/4 ton or 1-ton pickup. That's right the pickup you probably have sitting in the driveway is all you need.

And you'll need a fifth wheel hitch mounted in the bed of your truck if your going to pull 5th wheel trailers. As you'll be considered a commercial vehicle, things like reflector triangles, fire extinguisher, and log books will be required as well.
