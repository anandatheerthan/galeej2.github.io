Do contribute to a Roth IRA for contributions over and above what your employer matches with the 401(k). With a Roth, you will not get a tax deduction on contributions. But your earnings grow tax-free. And - here's the big one - earnings are tax-free at retirement. For most people, having tax-free <a href="http://www.garminhudreview.com/">clkick here</a> is better than being able to make contributions with pre-tax dollars.

For those who wish to move the funds themselves, your employer is required to hold back 20 percent of the balance for possible taxation. As long as you place the funds into a new qualified retirement plan within 60 days, though, those funds will be credited to your account.

This happens for a variety of reasons. Maybe you have lost your job and anything to do with your, now former, company seems tainted to you. Maybe you are hurt and angry and the idea of talking with Human Resources is laughable. Maybe you are moving to another city or, even to another country, and the 401k rollover is just one more thing you have to do before you are free to pursue this exciting new <a href="http://data.Gov.uk/data/search?q=opportunity">opportunity</a>.

They sell these 'leads', which are nothing more than names and numbers picked from the phonebook. Some of these people may even be on the Do Not Call list, which could land you in hot water.

1) Your current income and career choices. Will your career path allow you to match the rate of inflation or is there a possibility you can become upper management and make a six figure income in a few years? Obviously, a very difficult question to answer if you are just starting your career. Your income stream and investing early will weigh very heavily into your successful retirement.

Second, here is the truth: if you leave the current job or lose it (which is a grim reality), you owe all of the loan back within 60 days. If you are facing looking for a new job, and making ends meet with a seriously depleted cash flow, are you going to be in a place to write a check for $8,000? You will pay, one way or another. If you default on the loan, the entire amount becomes taxable income. So you pay now or you pay later. Better to avoid the temptation of borrowing at all.
