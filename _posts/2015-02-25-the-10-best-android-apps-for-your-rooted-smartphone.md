WhatsApp is an application available on iOS (iPad and iPhone), Android, Blackberry and Nokia that allows users to send <a href="http://En.Wiktionary.org/wiki/text+messages">text messages</a> to each other. Initially that does not sound very special, does it? That's because a few key features have been left out.<div style='text-align:center'></div>

No hidden costs: Once you and your friends download the application, you can use it to chat as much as you want. Send a million messages a day to your friends for free! WhatsApp uses your Internet connection: 3G/EDGE or Wi-Fi when available.

Facebook -owned Whatsapp appears to be working on a web-based version. A number of strings were found in the Android version of the app that point to a web-based Whatsapp. However, since Whatsapp doesn't use accounts, and is instead tied to a phone number, there is the issue of authentication. It appears that Whatsapp on the web may solve this with QR codes.<img class='aligncenter' style='margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto' src='http://www.webnews.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/320x154xw_web-320x154.jpg.pagespeed.ic.i_2rgOrp62.jpg' width='234' alt='whatsapp desktop' />

Way back in April, WhatsApp announced they were planning to add voice calling services to their popular messaging app in the second quarter of 2014 That time period came and went with no such addition. Now WhatsApp's CEO says they are targeting a first quarter 2015 date to add voice features.

Still Lacking Features In my opinion whatsapp is lacking in features compared to Viber. Would like to see its own app on Windows rather than using a <a href="https://Www.Vocabulary.com/dictionary/browser">browser</a>. Making voice calls is also a big one - something that Viber has done for a long time.

In the meantime if I am forced to use the website could you please support the Surface Pro 3 keyboard - it would be nice to see what i'm writing!!!
