Your WhatsApp conversations don't have to stay on your phone. In addition to creating backups of your entire conversation history in case your phone ever dies or needs to be restored, you can also export individual conversations, with or without any media you or your conversation partner shared while chatting.



<img src="http://media1.picsearch.com/is?6FsD4XakbiY1fpS3SYFkf5t3MlsuHaagnj3sQrdhOgQ&amp;height=223" alt="whatsapp spy" title="whatsapp spy (c) news.net" style="float:left;padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px">Previously, messages in WhatsApp had a single check next to them when they were sent from a person's phone, and a double check when they successfully arrived at a recipient's phone. This didn't mean, however, that the <a href="http://dict.leo.org/?search=recipient">recipient</a> had actually read the message - something WhatsApp even clarified on its official Twitter back in 2012. But now, those double checks will turn blue once the message has been opened.

At the same time our loyalty is to each other, not to a platform. No doubt we all will maintain our Whatsapp accounts, just as we have done with Viber and other platforms. We may only use those platforms for a couple of conversations, but they are important enough to have us not delete them from our phones. But we are prepared to migrate en masse when a better solution comes along, one that helps enough of a core group to have us all move.

WhatsApp conversations are exported as a plain text file, <a href="https://www.Jamendo.com/en/search?qs=fq=license_cc:(-nc%20AND%20-nd)&amp;q=readable">readable</a> on any operating system, which is automatically attached to an email message. If you choose to export the media that was included in the conversation, each individual media file is also separately attached to the email message. When choosing whether or not to include media, keep in mind that video and audio files can be fairly large and may cause the email message to be rejected  <a href="http://alvarezpuga.bitacoraap.com.mx/?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;task=user&amp;id=11936">whatsapp spy</a> if the recipient doesn't have enough space in his inbox or his email service places a hard restriction on the maximum size of an email attachment.<img class='aligncenter' style='margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto' src='http://www.allmobileworld.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/whatsapp-nokia.jpg' width='405' alt='whatsapp plus' /><img class='aligncenter' style='margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto' src='http://www.thedroid.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/thedroid-whatsapp%252B-next-generation-whatsapp-application-01.png' width='406' alt='whatsapp plus' />

People can also share photos and other content quickly by using Nokia's innovative Slam feature, which comes built-into the Nokia Asha 210. It works by enabling the transfer of content such as images or videos to another Bluetooth-enabled phone without the need to pair devices.

The alternate solution, of course, is to insist on just one communication method for people to contact you. You probably won't be able to keep in touch with as many people in your life, and it might be harder for people to reach you. But, perhaps, that's the price to pay for sanity.

Whether or not this is effective is another matter. It shouldn't be hard for these political opponents to find alternatives to Tango or Viber (WhatsApp comes to mind). Also, censorship of social apps has a tendency to galvanize resistance rather than break it down - whether or not the protesters are backing a good cause, they may see messaging blackouts as proof that they're fighting injustices.<img class='alignright' style='float:right;margin-left:10px' src='http://blog.laptopmag.com/wpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5_whatsapp_enter_phone_numb-266x400.jpg' width='403' alt='whatsapp check marks' /><div style='text-align:center'></div>

Then on Thursday, the Washington Post reported that Facebook and Microsoft, the company that owns Skype, are among several of the biggest Internet companies that participate in PRISM , a government program that allows the National Security Agency and the FBI broad access to the companies' servers. Both companies have denied they participate in any such program If you loved this short article and you would like to obtain more details regarding http://whatsappspy.weakwiki.com, <a href="http://www.dirtydoubledozen.com/nuke/modules.php?name=Your_Account&amp;op=userinfo&amp;username=AprilCCFLx">http://www.dirtydoubledozen.com/nuke/modules.php?Name=your_account&amp;op=userinfo&amp;username=aprilccflx</a>, kindly browse through our own site. .
